|  New Features  |  You can now Lambda edge locations in conjunction with CloudFront as Lambda@Edge\. For more information, see [Using CloudFront with Lambda@Edge](lambda-at-the-edge.md)\. Regional Edge Caches are edge locations between your web server and global edge locations\. For more information, see [How CloudFront Works with Regional Edge Caches](HowCloudFrontWorks.md#CloudFrontRegionaledgecaches)\.  |  November 30, 2016  | 
|  New Feature  |  You can now secure communication between viewers and CloudFront, and between CloudFront and ELB load balancers, by importing third\-party certificates\. For more information, see [Using HTTPS with CloudFront](using-https.md)\.  |  October 13, 2016  | 
|  New Feature  |  The account that you use to create or update a web or RTMP distribution now requires additional permissions if you want to enable access logs for the distribution\. For more information, see [Permissions Required to Configure Logging and to Access Your Log Files](AccessLogs.md#AccessLogsBucketAndFileOwnership)\.  |  September 19, 2016  | 
|  New Feature  |  You can now choose the HTTP version, HTTP/2 or HTTP/1\.1, that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront\. Viewers use the latest version that you configure CloudFront to use\. If you choose HTTP/2, viewers that don't support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier version\. For more information, see the description for the [Supported HTTP Versions](distribution-web-values-specify.md#DownloadDistValuesSupportedHTTPVersions) field\.  |  September 7, 2016  | 
|  New Feature  |  For web distributions, you can now choose the query string parameters that CloudFront uses as a basis for caching your objects\. For more information, see [Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters](QueryStringParameters.md)\.  |  August 30, 2016  |

|  New Feature  |  You can now configure a maximum time\-to\-live \(TTL\) and a default TTL to specify how long CloudFront caches your objects in edge locations\. You can set the TTL at the edge when your origin doesn't include a `Cache-Control max-age`, `Cache-Control s-maxage`, or `Expires` header in the response, or you can override the header value\. For more information, see [Specifying How Long Objects Stay in a CloudFront Edge Cache \(Expiration\)](Expiration.md)\.  |  June 17, 2015  | 
|  New Feature  |  The invalidation feature, which allows you to remove objects from CloudFront edge caches before they expire, now supports the \* wildcard character\. You can add a \* wildcard character at the end of an invalidation path to remove all objects that match this path\. For more information, see [Invalidating Objects \(Web Distributions Only\)](Invalidation.md)\.  |  May 21, 2015  |

For more information, see [Configuring CloudFront to Cache Objects Based on Request Headers](header-caching.md)\.  |  June 26, 2014  | 
|  New Feature  |  Amazon CloudFront now works with AWS CloudTrail to capture information about every request that your AWS account \(including your IAM users\) sends to the CloudFront API\. Integrating CloudFront and CloudTrail lets you determine which requests were made to the CloudFront API, the source IP address from which each request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and more\. For more information about using CloudFront with CloudTrail, see [Using AWS CloudTrail to Capture Requests Sent to the CloudFront API](logging_using_cloudtrail.md)\.  |  May 28, 2014  | 
|  New Feature  |  With this release, for HTTPS viewer requests that CloudFront forwards to a custom origin, CloudFront validates that one of the domain names in the SSL certificate on your origin server matches the domain name that you specify for **Origin Domain Name**\. If the domain names don't match, CloudFront responds to viewer requests with an HTTP status code 502 \(bad gateway\) instead of the requested objects\. To enable this functionality, you must specify an **Origin Protocol Policy** of **Match Viewer**\. For more information, see [Using HTTPS with CloudFront](using-https.md)\.  |  May 16, 2014  | 
|  New Feature  |  This release of CloudFront introduces a new field in CloudFront access logs for web distributions\.
