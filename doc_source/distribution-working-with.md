# Working with Distributions<a name="distribution-working-with"></a>

You create a CloudFront distribution to tell CloudFront where you want content to be delivered from, and the details about how to track and manage content delivery\. The following topics explain some basics about CloudFront distributions and provide detailed information about the settings you can choose to configure your distributions to meet your business needs\.

**Note**  
If you are using Adobe Flash Media Server's RTMP protocol, you set up a different kind of CloudFront distribution\. For more information, see [Working with RTMP Distributions](distribution-rtmp.md)\.
