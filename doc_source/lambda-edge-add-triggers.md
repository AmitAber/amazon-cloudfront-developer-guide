# Adding Triggers for a Lambda@Edge Function<a name="lambda-edge-add-triggers"></a>

You specify one or more CloudFront events, known as triggers, that cause a Lambda function to execute\. For example, you can create a trigger that causes the function to execute when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer\.

At the time that you create a Lambda function, you can specify only one triggerâ€”that is, only one combination of CloudFront distribution, cache behavior, and event that causes the function to execute\. But you can add more triggers to the same function later by using the Lambda console or by editing the distribution in the CloudFront console\.
+ Using the Lambda console works well if you want to add more triggers to a function for the same CloudFront distribution\.
+ Using the CloudFront console can be better if you want to add triggers for multiple distributions because it's easier to find the distribution that you want to update\. You can also update other CloudFront settings at the same time\.

**Note**  
If you want to work with Lambda@Edge programmatically, there are several resources to help you\. For more information, see [Creating Lambda Functions and CloudFront Triggers Programmatically](lambda-edge-create-programmatically.md)\.
