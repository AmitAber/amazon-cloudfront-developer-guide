# Adding, Removing, or Replacing Objects in a Distribution<a name="AddRemoveReplaceObjects"></a>

For information about adding objects to a distribution, see [Adding Objects that You Want CloudFront to Distribute](AddingObjects.md)\.

When you replace objects in your distribution, we recommend that you use versioned object names\. For more information, see [Updating Existing Objects Using Versioned Object Names](ReplacingObjects.md)\. You can also replace objects with objects that have the same name\. See [Updating Existing Objects Using the Same Object Names](ReplacingObjectsSameName.md)\. Regardless of how you choose to replace objects in your distribution, we recommend that you specify when objects should be removed from the CloudFront cache\. For more information, see [Specifying How Long Objects Stay in a CloudFront Edge Cache \(Expiration\)](Expiration.md)\. 

If you need to quickly remove objects from a distribution, you can invalidate them\. For more information, see [Invalidating Objects \(Web Distributions Only\)](Invalidation.md)\.
