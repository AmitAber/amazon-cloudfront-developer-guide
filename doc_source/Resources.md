## Tools and Code Examples for Configuring Private Content<a name="resources-distributing-private-content"></a>

In addition to the methods provided by CloudFront, the following third\-party tools provide web forms for configuring your distribution for private content\. Some of the tools also provide web forms for creating signed URLs\.
+ **CloudBerry** – Supports configuring a distribution for private content and supports creating signed URLs\.

  For information about using [CloudBerry](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/) for CloudFront private content, go to [How to Configure Private Content for CloudFront Streaming with CloudBerry](http://blog.cloudberrylab.com/2010/03/how-to-configure-private-content-for.html)\.

  For information on setting a default root object, see [How to set CloudFront Default Object with CloudBerry S3 Explorer](http://blog.cloudberrylab.com/2010/08/how-to-set-cloudfront-default-object.html)\.

For more information about private content, see the blog post [New Amazon CloudFront Feature: Private Content](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2009/11/new-amazon-cloudfront-feature-private-content.html) on the AWS blog\.

For an example of how to use signed cookies, use your domain name in object URLs, and still use the SSL certificate for the cloudfront\.net domain, see the Space Vatican blog post [Using CloudFront Signed Cookies](http://www.spacevatican.org/2015/5/1/using-cloudfront-signed-cookies/)\. This allows you to use an alternate domain name with HTTPS without incurring the expense of dedicated IP addresses or the limitations of SNI, as documented in [Using Alternate Domain Names and HTTPS](using-https-alternate-domain-names.md)\.
